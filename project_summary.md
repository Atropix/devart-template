## Description
By Coincidence and overloading my Graphics Card with Dogecoin-Mining and hooking up my PCR-M30 MIDI controller, I noticed, that I could control Youtube- and Soundcloud-Streams in Realtime, where every Action I did on the keyboard made significant results on the Output of my Computer. I'm totally new to coding, and so I need help to finish my vision.
